# TinySSB | 2025-02-16

present: Mix + Nanomonkey

Agenda
- [x] udpates
- [x] completing the spec
- [x] discuss firmware repo experience
- [ ] split out signal chats? Revisit Zulip?
- [ ] scaling challenge

## Updates

Mix
- hosted the JS API call
    - was rad to have input
    - => Mix is gonna bring a proposal to community (not done yet)
- testing Nanomonkey's `esp32-firmware` install instructions
    - hit some challenges, keen to discuss

Nanomonkey
- `esp32-firmware` instructions
- split out different repos
- CFT + Nano did a talk at Internet Archive
    - met Day W!
    - people expect the network to "just work" after installing?!
    - some people think offline-first was invented in 2019 :laughing: 
    - our talk was a lot more advanced than others!
- reviewed + merged Mix's spec PR
- researching coordinated compression on distributed databases


## Completing the Spec

Still needed:
- feed message headers
    - previous_msg_id encoding?
    - side-chains
    - bipf
- replication
    - goset - coordinating who we're talking about
    - wants
    - chunk
- test vectors!
    - define targets (what needs vectors?)
- links to reference implementations
- a version tag


The arc of the spec:
1. Intro - what is this?
2. Design Descisions (constraints of LoRa, et al)
3. Encoding => BIPF
4. Known Public Keys (GOSET)
5. Feeds
    - main chain
    - side chain
6. WANT requests
7. CHUNK requests
8. FAQ
    - does this have routing?
    - does this have hop count?
    - is this the same as meshtastic?
    - are there ACKs?
    
    
## Firmware Repo Testing

new firmware repo:
- mix hit problems with
    - arduino complaining about "dialout" group
        - => needs more debugging
    - many the vendor libraries: no name+version match for many
        - => gonna look into vendoring all the libraries! 

CFT's `cft-twatch` branch:
- seems like serveral libraries are missing
- mix to try this out


## Actions

Mix
- [ ] spec PR: side-chain format
- [ ] Mix working on getting firmware flashing
    - [ ] give feedback to Nano + CFT

Nano
- [ ] spec PR: start at bipf, goset, (continue down)
