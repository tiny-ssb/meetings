## Updates

### CFT + Nanomonkey met in person

met at a midpoint in Milpitas (between Oakland and Santa Cruz mountains)

- full day of esp32 hacking
  - got the toolchain working again => can compile
    - mix: did you record the versions of all the libraries?
    - cft: yes!
    - thinking to make a prepared binaryfor most common versions
  - support for modern semtech LoRa SX1262 working
  - did this work on branch: https://github.com/ssbc/tinySSB/tree/loramesh-esp32-sx1262
- started prioritizing the work items, discussed
  1. put emphasis on the web access-point (LoRa + web facade)
    - if we get SD card support we could share the APK for tiny-ssb
    - provide a configuration dashboard
    - mini-client running?
  2. ... some more technical stuff
  
### Mix: started on spec

- https://github.com/tiny-ssb/tiny-ssb-spec/pull/1

### Jiang: building community scheduling app

- investigating how I could use ssb / tiny-ssb to go local-first
- moving towards a mobile app
- SocialLayer => https://app.sola.day

mix : it would be great to know more details about what Social Layer is aiming for in terms of numbers of people, events
- Jiang - pop up cities
  - 10-500 people
  - few to 100 events over a month
  - art festivals
  - currently have internet connectivity, but interested in supporting remote areas
  - mix: do you have any requirements aroun privacy?
    - jiang: mostly public, but some would like to go private, invite-only
  - cft: is it currently server based?
    - jiang: yes, but in process of redesigning


## Where are we

- working towards "Scheduling App" for offline-first event like Dweb Camp
- making the foudnations stable + accessible
- 2025 opportunity: this year there will be smaller events, probabaly less than 100 participants per event
- 

### Spec work

- CFT happy to review the PR 1,
  - can aim for this within 2-4 weeks
- will also do some archaeology around original designs, rationale.

- demo done in december
  - PDF to come
  - Nico did a recording: https://youtu.be/CZ8B3fOwCbc
