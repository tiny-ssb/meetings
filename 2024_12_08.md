## Previous Actions

Mix
  - [ ] make PR with CoC which is a fork of SSB's
  - [ ] change https://github.com/tiny-ssb/tiny-shed-design/pull/1
      - to merge into `user_flows/admin.md` ...
 
CFT
  - [/] process the dweb interview => informed assessment

  - [x] ask 2 students for their reflections on interview 
  - [x] share demo application (running in standalone Chrome), show it next meeting
  - [ ] independently: blog as a target mini-app? We have rough CRDT design for it (minimal access control: comments must be approved by blog owner). Could also be shopping-list mini-app, as an easy warm-up for programming?

Nano
  - [ ] ask Tyler for his reflections on IA "DWeb camp program creation" session

## tiny-updates

### Mix + Nano meeting

https://github.com/tiny-ssb/meetings/blob/main/2024_11_27-task_planning.md

High level
- start using issues to plan work
  - focusing on documentation first
  - mix starting with JS API
  - nano starting to prep protocol issues
- we should have test-vectors


### Agus and Nico exploration

Agus and Nico exploration of http server within tinyssb

Been exploring how it would be to add a REST server on tinyssb to provide an interface to ATAK
- allow ATAK to read+write via tiny-ssb

Agus was able to have a fully running dev env, run apk.
Next steps is to do a mock of a server that ATAK can connect to.

Will report more as we go.
