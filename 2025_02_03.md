## Updates

mix:
  - met up with Nano, spent an hour trying to build T-Beam code
  - merged some PRs in design repo
  - started trying to modularise the JS code
  - did first open-collective payment!

nico:
  - firefighters:
    - blogpost: https://nico.today/exploring-the-integration-of-meshtastic-and-atak-in-firefighting-communications-a-practice-with-chiviquin-brigade/
    - exploring using tiny-ssb to synchronise state for firefighters
    - feedback - groups interested in trying out tech
    - figuring out next steps
         
nanomonkey:
  - lots of people reaching out about LoRa / DisasterRadio
      - people from India: safety for women (via ??)
      - guy interested in adventure/explorer app for skiiers (via HackerNews)
      - some USA activists
      - not sure about recommended MeshTastic (is it still just flooding? encryption?)
  - dweb reached out inviting a talk on TinySSB for Feb 11th
      - nico: I think it would be good for Nanomonkey to give the talk to decentralize the perspectives.
      - nico: If you wanna talk about Meshtastic, I'm here! TL;DR it's safe but there needs to be a guide for safety
      - zachary: I host monthly Hawaii decentralized meetup, you're welcome to come present!

notplants:
  - love the "event network which falls back to emergency" approach
  - working with Cory on TildeFriends to integrate it's C core into PeachPub
  - interested in Rust / Python (maybe Go)

andrew:
  - intersted in doing some hardware work as a side, have an esp32, and a book to work with
  - keen to help out with testing + tinkering, docs
  - working at awana, busy, but only a little time to help out


notplants:

- what's the timeline for finishing the spec?
    - mix: lots of knowledge in cft's head. nano + mix been trying to extract that so that others can help out + get involved
    - mix: cft's approach to open source differs from my experience. been trying to figure out how to update things so that it's more friendly for open source involvement




## accessibility => JS API

https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/tremola

Mix: current state is that there is a highly coupled repo. I think I've identified a point for 
    
1. question: anyone interested in helping with designing the API?
    - Nano + Andrew
    - Mix: cool! yes I'm 
    - Zachary: any interest in an OpenApi Swagger spec approach?
        - Mix: are you interested in bringing those skills?
        - Zachary: yes, would love to
        - Mix: cool we'll loop you in as we go
        - Nico: I think it's web api based? Lets see
2. question: anyone interested in helping execute the JS-API modularization?
    - Nanomonkey: can we have a modularization party?
        - Mix: I'm scared of splitting the whole thing up and putting it back together. Keen to pull parts out and replace as pieces
        - Nano: I think we'll see the libraries emerge as we see pull things out
    - Andrew: might be interested





## accessibility => docs

- [ ] spec PR: https://github.com/tiny-ssb/tiny-ssb-spec/pull/1
- [ ] building T-Beam code


## naming of repos

https://github.com/tiny-ssb/ ...

- andy => android app
- loramesh => the esp32 code
- coatl => python pub code (websocket)

- tiny-shed-design
- tiny-ssb-spec
- meetings

### Proposal A: prefix everthing!

e.g. `tiny-ssb-________`



### Proposal B: study Meshtastic's success

Nico: I think they've done very practical descriptive names

`tiny-ssb/firmware`
- leave off esp32 as it will be replaced?
- one repo per board :-1:

`tiny-ssb/android`

`tiny-ssb/python-peer` <= TODO?

Write the README to discuss

`tiny-ssb/website` ... URL



## Actions

Mix
- [ ] get my spec PR reviewed
- [ ] organise JS API call
- [ ] progress `firmware` repo

Nico
- [ ] review Mix's PR: https://github.com/tiny-ssb/tiny-ssb-spec/pull/1

Nanomonkey
- [ ] review Mix's PR: https://github.com/tiny-ssb/tiny-ssb-spec/pull/1
- [ ] 


Zachary
- [ ] research various API spec approaches, various tradeoffs and considerations suitable to the project, with focus on cross-ecosystem tooling and adoption
